            SOCIAL COPY TRADING
        </h1>
        <p>
            Social trading can be extremely beneficial when it 
            comes to trading financial markets. Experienced traders 
            can earn additional income by having followers on our 
            platform that replicate their trading strategy. On top 
            of their own trading profits, they can receive a 
            commission from the followers that are replicating 
            their trades. <br> <br>
            Beginners can mimic the trades of more experienced 
            traders, having the chance to learn and benefit from 
            their success. They only have to choose their favorite 
            trader to copy on our platform and automatically copy 
            their trades on our platform.
